# How to release `jsonrpsee`

1. Bump the version of all crates
1. Run all tests
1. In the `CHANGELOG.md` file, move everything under "Unreleased" to a new section named `## [vx.y.z] â€“ YYYY-MM-DD`
1. Make a dryrun like so:
	1. Ensure you're in the project root dir
	1. Run: `./scripts/publish.sh --dry-run --allow-dirty` (If you are running this against the master branch, you may omit the `--allow-dirty` flag)
1. Once published, make sure to "create a release" for the pushed tag on github.
